Guided OAuth lets you test your OAuth implementation step-by-step. The feature works functionally, but we're actively making improvements. The guided OAuth testing is compliant to [MCP OAuth](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/draft/basic/authorization).

## Protocol Versions

The debugger supports multiple MCP OAuth protocol versions:

- **2025-03-26** - Original MCP OAuth specification with direct discovery from MCP server base URL
- **2025-06-18** - Current specification with Protected Resource Metadata (RFC9728)
- **2025-11-25** - Draft specification with Client ID Metadata Documents (CIMD) support

Select your protocol version in the OAuth debugger to test against the appropriate specification.

## OAuth Steps

1. Metadata Discovery
2. Client Registration
3. Request & fetch auth code
4. Request access token

## Features

### Edit Configuration

You can edit your server configuration during OAuth testing without reconnecting. Click the **Edit Config** button to modify settings like:

- Server URL
- OAuth scopes
- Custom headers
- Environment variables

Changes update the OAuth flow immediately, regenerating the authorization URL with your new configuration.

### Copy Logs

Export OAuth logs for debugging or sharing with your team. Click **Copy logs** to copy in two formats:

- **Guide view** - Step-by-step explanation with teachable moments and tips
- **Raw view** - Complete timeline with all HTTP requests and responses

### Transport Detection

The debugger automatically detects deprecated HTTP+SSE transport and displays a warning. If your server uses this older transport, you'll see a yellow badge with migration guidance to the modern Streamable HTTP transport (2025-03-26).
