Test your MCP server's implementation of tools, prompts, and resources. You can manually trigger them to quickly iterate on your implementation.

## Tools

<Frame>
  <img
    className="block"
    src="/images/demo_1.png"
    alt="MCPJam Inspector Logo"
    width="300"
  />
</Frame>

- View all tools, tool name, tool description.
- Search for tools
- View tool params
- Trigger a tool with params
- Support for elicitation

### Save requests

You can save a tool request. Saved requests will show up in the `Saved Requests` tab. They are stored in your browser local storage. Clicking on a saved request will fill out a tool with the params you saved.

## Resources

- View all resources, resource name, location, mimetype
- Read a resource

## Prompts

- View all prompts, prompt name, prompt description
- View prompt params
- Fetch a prompt with given params

### Using prompts in the playground

You can use MCP prompts directly in the LLM playground by typing `/` in the chat input. This opens a menu of available prompts from your connected servers. When you select a prompt, it appears as an expandable card showing the server, description, arguments, and a preview of the content before you send it to the LLM.
