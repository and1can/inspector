Each workspace saves its own set of MCP servers. Switch between workspaces with one click, connect multiple servers in each, and share any workspace with teammates so everyone works with the same configuration.

## Key Features

- **Multiple Servers** - Connect to several MCP servers within a single workspace
- **Save Your Setup** - Store all your server configurations in one place
- **Share Instantly** - Invite team members via email to access the same workspace
- **Real-Time Sync** - Changes update automatically for all workspace members
- **Switch Contexts** - Jump between different workspace setups with one click

## Getting Started

1. **Click the workspace name** in the header bar
2. **Create a workspace** - Click "Add Workspace" and give it a name
3. **Add your servers** - Configure your MCP servers in the Servers tab
4. **Share with your team** - Click the share button and invite collaborators

<Info>
When you switch workspaces, all servers disconnect automatically to give you a clean slate.

## Sharing Workspaces

Workspace sharing lets your entire team work with the same servers. Set up your workspace once, invite your team by email, and everyone gets access to the same servers with the same configurations instantly.

### What Gets Shared

Members get access to every server in the workspace with the same configuration.

<Note>
For security, authorization headers and OAuth tokens are never shared. Each team member authenticates with their own credentials when connecting to servers that require authentication.
</Note>

### Real-Time Sync

Changes sync instantly between all workspace members. New servers and configuration changes update automatically for everyone.

### How to Share a Workspace

1. **Sign in** - Sharing requires authentication
2. **Click the member avatars** in the header (or the share button)
3. **Enter an email address** of the person you want to invite
4. **Click "Invite"** to send the invitation

Once they sign in with that email address, the shared workspace will appear in their workspace list.

### Managing Members

If you created the workspace, you can remove any member by clicking the X next to their name.

If you're not the creator, you can leave the workspace at any time. The creator can also remove you from the workspace.
