Use the LLM playground to test your server against different LLMs. This is helpful to simulate how LLMs interpret your server and test for hallucinations.

The playground is also great for simulating agent behaviors. You can customize the system prompt, swap models, and configure system prompts and temperature as if you would building an agent.

### Ollama

Make sure you have [Ollama installed](https://ollama.com/), and the MCPJam Ollama URL configuration is pointing to your Ollama instance.

Start an Ollama instance with `ollama serve <model>`. MCPJam will automatically detect any Ollama models running.

### LiteLLM Proxy

Use [LiteLLM Proxy](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/proxy/quick_start) to connect to 100+ LLMs through a unified OpenAI-compatible interface.

1. **Start LiteLLM Proxy**: Follow the [LiteLLM Proxy Quick Start Guide](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/proxy/quick_start) to set up your proxy server
2. **Configure in MCPJam**: Go to Settings → LiteLLM card → Click "Configure"
3. **Enter Connection Details**:
   - **Base URL**: Your LiteLLM proxy URL (default: `http://localhost:4000`)
   - **API Key**: Your proxy API key (use the same key you use in your API requests)
   - **Model Aliases**: Comma-separated list of model names configured in your proxy (e.g., `gpt-3.5-turbo, claude-3-opus, gemini-pro`)

<Info>
  Use the exact model names that work with your LiteLLM proxy's
  `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint. These are typically the model names without
  provider prefixes (e.g., `gpt-3.5-turbo` instead of `openai/gpt-3.5-turbo`).
</Info>

**Example configuration:**

```yaml
# In your LiteLLM config.yaml
model_list:
  - model_name: gpt-3.5-turbo
    litellm_params:
      model: openai/gpt-3.5-turbo
      api_key: os.environ/OPENAI_API_KEY
```

Then in MCPJam, use `gpt-3.5-turbo` as the model alias.

## Choose an LLM model

Once you've configured your LLM API keys, go to the Playground tab. On the bottom near the text input, you should see a LLM model selector. Select the model from the ones you've configured

  />
</Frame>

## System prompt and temperature

You can configure the system prompt and temperature, just like you would building an agent. The temperature is defaulted to the default value of the LLM providers (Claude = 0, OpenAI = 1.0).

<Info>
  Higher temperature settings tend to hallucinate more with MCP interactions
</Info>

## Using MCP prompts in chat

You can use MCP prompts directly in the playground chat by typing `/` to trigger the prompts menu. When you select a prompt, it appears as an expandable card above the chat input showing:

- **Server name** - Which MCP server provides the prompt
- **Description** - What the prompt does
- **Arguments** - Required and optional parameters
- **Preview** - A preview of the prompt content

Click the card to expand/collapse details, or click the X button to remove it before sending. This helps you understand what will be sent to the LLM before submitting your message.

## Playground layout

The playground features a split-panel layout with:

- **Chat panel** (left) - Your conversation with the LLM, including tool calls and results
- **JSON-RPC logger** (right) - Real-time view of MCP protocol messages between Inspector and your servers

You can resize the panels by dragging the divider between them. This layout helps you understand exactly how the LLM interacts with your MCP servers.

## Error handling

When errors occur during playground interactions, you'll see an error message with a "Reset chat" button. For detailed debugging, click "More details" to expand additional error information, including JSON-formatted error responses when available. This helps you quickly identify and resolve issues with your MCP server or LLM configuration.

## Elicitation support

MCPJam has elicitation support in the LLM playground. Any elicitation requests will be shown as a popup modal.

## MCP-UI support

The playground supports rendering custom UI components from MCP servers using the [MCP-UI specification](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/mcp-ui). When an MCP tool returns a UI resource, it will be rendered inline in the chat with interactive capabilities.

MCP-UI components can:

- Display rich, interactive visualizations
- Trigger tool calls through button actions
- Send follow-up messages to the chat
- Open external links
- Show notifications

This enables MCP server developers to create custom user experiences beyond plain text responses.

## ChatGPT Apps and MCP Apps support

The playground supports rendering custom UI components from MCP tools using both the [OpenAI Apps SDK](https://developers.openai.com/apps-sdk) (ChatGPT apps) and MCP Apps.

**ChatGPT Apps**: When a tool includes an `openai/outputTemplate` metadata field pointing to a resource URI, the playground will render the custom HTML interface in an isolated iframe with access to the `window.openai` API.

**MCP Apps**: When a tool includes a `ui/resourceUri` metadata field, the playground will render the custom UI component inline in the chat.

This enables MCP servers to provide rich, interactive visualizations for tool results, including charts, forms, and custom widgets that can call other tools or send followup messages to the chat.

### Display modes

OpenAI Apps can request different display modes to optimize their presentation:

- **Inline** (default) - Widget renders within the chat message flow
- **Picture-in-Picture** - Widget floats at the top of the screen, staying visible while you scroll through the chat
- **Fullscreen** - Widget expands to fill the entire viewport for immersive experiences

Widgets can request display mode changes using `window.openai.requestDisplayMode({ mode: 'pip' })` or `window.openai.requestDisplayMode({ mode: 'fullscreen' })`. Users can exit PiP or fullscreen modes by clicking the close button in the top-left corner of the widget.

## UI Playground device settings

The UI Playground provides controls to simulate different device environments for testing ChatGPT Apps and MCP Apps. These settings affect how widgets receive device context through the `window.openai` API.

### Device type

Select between mobile, tablet, or desktop device types. This affects the `window.openai.userAgent.device.type` value that widgets receive. The device type selector is located in the playground toolbar.

### Device capabilities

Toggle hover and touch capabilities to simulate different input methods:

- **Hover** - Indicates whether the device supports hover interactions (typically enabled for desktop, disabled for mobile)
- **Touch** - Indicates whether the device supports touch input (typically enabled for mobile/tablet, disabled for desktop)

These settings are reflected in `window.openai.userAgent.capabilities.hover` and `window.openai.userAgent.capabilities.touch`.

### Safe area insets

Configure safe area insets to simulate device notches, rounded corners, and gesture areas. Click the safe area button in the toolbar to open the editor, which provides:

- **Visual preview** - Shows how insets affect the content area
- **Preset configurations** - Quick access to common device profiles:
  - **None** - No insets (0px on all sides)
  - **Notch** - iPhone with notch (44px top, 34px bottom)
  - **Island** - iPhone with Dynamic Island (59px top, 34px bottom)
  - **Android** - Android gesture navigation (24px top, 16px bottom)
- **Custom values** - Manually adjust top, bottom, left, and right insets in pixels

Widgets receive these values through `window.openai.safeArea.insets` and can use them to adjust their layout accordingly.

#### Fullscreen navigation

When a widget is in fullscreen mode, a navigation header appears at the top with:

- **Back/Forward buttons** - Navigate through the widget's browsing history (enabled when navigation is available)
- **Widget title** - Displays the tool name
- **Close button** - Exit fullscreen mode

The navigation buttons mirror the widget's internal history state, allowing you to navigate multi-page widgets without leaving fullscreen mode.
