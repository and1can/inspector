## Quick Start

Start MCPJam Inspector with a single command:

```bash
npx @mcpjam/inspector@latest
```

After installation completes, you'll see a link to `localhost`. Open that link in your browser to access the inspector.

<Note>
  Don't have Node.js installed? Download our desktop app for [Mac](https://github.com/MCPJam/inspector/releases/latest/download/MCPJam.Inspector.dmg) or [Windows](https://github.com/MCPJam/inspector/releases/latest/download/MCPJam-Inspector-Setup.exe).
</Note>

## Connect Your First MCP Server

Click "Add server" and connect to an MCP server. For this example, we'll use Anthropic's sample server:

```bash
npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-everything
```

</Frame>

Once you submit, the connection status should show "Connected". You can connect to multiple MCP servers simultaneously on MCPJam.

## Test an MCP Tool

Navigate to the "Tools" tab to see all available tools from `server-everything`. This tab lets you manually test individual tools with custom parameters.

Try the `add` tool:
1. Select the `add` tool from the list
2. Set parameters for `a` and `b`
3. Click "Execute"
4. View the tool's return value at the bottom
