The inspector lets you test whether or not you built your MCP server correctly. You can test your server's tools, prompts, OAuth implementation, and more. If your server works on MCPJam, it'll work with any LLM client.

## Quick Start

Start up the MCPJam inspector with a bash command

## MCPJam Inspector can

- Test your MCP tools, prompts, and resources. Manually trigger your server features to quickly iterate on its development.
- Validate your OAuth 2 implementation with the OAuth step by step feature.
- Check your MCP server's behavior against different LLM's in the LLM playground. Simulate how your server would behave in environments like Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, and more.
- Debug JSON-RPC messages sent back and forth between your server and client.
