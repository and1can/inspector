MCPJam Inspector is the local development platform for ChatGPT apps, MCP apps (Claude), and MCP servers. Build and test your apps with a full widget emulator, chat with any LLM, and inspect your server's tools, resources, prompts, and OAuth flows. MCPJam is the fastest way to iterate on any MCP project.

## Quick Start

Start up the MCPJam inspector with a bash command

## MCPJam Inspector can

- Build and test ChatGPT apps and MCP apps with a full widget emulator that supports custom UI components and interactive visualizations.
- Test your MCP tools, prompts, and resources. Manually trigger your server features to quickly iterate on its development.
- Validate your OAuth 2 implementation with the OAuth step by step feature.
- Check your MCP server's behavior against different LLMs in the LLM playground. Simulate how your server would behave in environments like Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, and more.
- Debug JSON-RPC messages sent back and forth between your server and client.
